# Voltage Divider Circuit

This project showcases a **Voltage Divider**, one of the most fundamental and versatile building blocks in electronics. Using two resistors in series, the circuit divides input voltage into a lower output voltage.

## Features
- Simple voltage level adjustment
- Customizable resistor ratios
- Ideal for signal scaling

## Components
- 2 resistors (R1, R2)
- Power supply
- Optional: Load resistor for testing

## Applications
- Analog sensors
- Level shifting
- Biasing transistors
