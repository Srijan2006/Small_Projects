# Wheatstone Bridge Circuit

This project demonstrates a **Wheatstone Bridge**, a classic configuration used to precisely measure unknown resistances. The bridge consists of four resistors arranged in a diamond shape, with voltage applied across the bridge and a galvanometer used to detect balance.

## Features
- Precision resistance measurement
- Adjustable resistor for balancing the bridge
- Useful for strain gauge applications

## Components
- 4 resistors (R1, R2, R3, Rx)
- Power supply
- Optional: Potentiometer for R3 or R4

## Applications
- Sensor calibration
- Instrumentation
- Analog circuit experimentation
